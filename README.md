# ActiveArchive

ActiveArchive is an object-relational-mapping library built with Ruby and inspired by ActiveRecord.

## Features Within this Library Include:
* Create ruby objects or models representing individual database tables
* Use models to perform SQL queries to fetch and alter data from appropriate database tables
* Models possess instance methods as alternatives to building SQL queries. Methods include #all, #where, #find, and #update.
* Build belongs_to, has_many, and has_one_through associations between models to simplify SQL queries across multiple database tables
